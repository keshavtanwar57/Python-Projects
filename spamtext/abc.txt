Go over there to that building.

Brother, can you break this bill?

-Yes.

Please help me today God.

I applied for a job here.

My dad used to work here as well.

He died in the 1992 fire.

I should be the one to get the job.

Go there.

Shyam

I had applied for a job.

- Go there.

I had applied for a job.

- No, no - go there.

I don't understand. Why are you

shuttling me from here to there

Hey, come over here...

what's the matter?

Who was the former employee?

- My father

The name?

- Shyam.

So when did Mr. Shyam die?

- Shyam is my name.

My father's name was Sunderlal...

he died on December , 2.

There was another person who

died with your father in the

hospital - Shiv Shanker...

- Yes.

His next-of-kin has also

applied for this job.

As he was senior to your father

so he gets the preference.

Sir, my father died first how

can he be senior?

I see, but in the hospital

both died on the same day.

As per hospital seniority my

father died min 28 sec sooner

So he had the first right?

- Perhaps .

Similar problem arose 0 months

ago as my father was 8 min late

Now I've the death certificate

and sent a copy to head office.

Give some time to resolve it.

- Some time? - (Yes.)

It has already taken 6 years -

I'm indebted to dogs and cats.

I'll rather commit suicide than

return to my village -

No don't take your life, I'll

recommend - rest is your luck.

What is this, yes tell me...?

- Sir, it's the suit.

Originally it was a suit -

it is no longer a suit!

I thought you're educated so I

put you on ironing job, but ...

trouser and now a suit

You're progressing negatively -

I'll cook dal but I won't fry.

Okay, I can Live with

non-fried dal.

What's this indecent behavior?

- You won't see indecent...

Why are you standing

here Like a watchman.

See Baburao...

What's there to see.

Ask him to come out

I've to go for interview.

Toilet isn't a place

for interview.

Raju you come out, let him go.

- You don't interfere

He isn't doing anything in

there. He's just teasing me.

I've kept the door open

just come and have a look.

You're a mature man you go in.

- Oh God - do I have to see?

Oh, he broke my chest!

Pick up.

her up? She's about 40 kilogram

If you've some problem

I can come later.

Not really - we're

Who is Shyam amongst you?

- I'm Shyam.

Would you come here?

You've some work with me.

She has come for me.

Saw?

- No, I had covered myself.

I'm not taking about this.

There are girls after Shyam.

Maybe she is his sister.

- And so fair! How do you know?

Because she's wearing glasses.

- You would be their father!

Why do you always go to

ICI Bank and create scene?

For getting a job!

It doesn't look good

for a man Like you.

It's their mistake! They want

to give my job to someone else.

Bank manager knows who deserves

that job. You just sign here.

I was confident of getting this

job one day. Where do I sign?

What does this mean?

- You no longer need this job.

So that Shiv Shanker's

next-of-kin can get this job.

I'll not sign. As long as I'm

alive he won't get this job.

I'll get the job as I'm next-

of-kin of Shiv Shanker.

But think by defeating me you

can be happy in this city.

Why? Are you the city queen?

- I'm the Bandit Queen?

Sister, please listen.

- What is it?

I want to help you and you

are being rude to me.

I don't want your help.

- Only I can solve your problem

How?

- I can get you the N.O.C.

I know he'll not give that

letter but I can get it for you

If you don't want my help

it is okay.

please wait...

Can you really do it.

I never lie. You Look Like my

sister so I want to help.

Shyam is my childhood friend.

he'll do whatever I tell him.

But I saw you two fighting.

This goes on between

two loving friends.

But we have fought

on this matter.

You don't worry. Tell me

what you want in the letter.

In Borivili a tenant has beaten

his landlord and kicked him out

A tenant choked his landlord

because of his girlfriend.
Affair with women is very bad -

men kill their parents...

it's so easy to kill a landlord

Homeowners are fools.

They take tenants for money and

don't get anything in writing.

Do you have a house in village?

- No, why?

What if Shyam throws you out

of this house? Where'll you go?

hold your tongue!

- See he is so defensive.

he'll bring so many girls that

they'll throw you out of house.

According to my horoscope

I must commit one murder...

And must murder a murderer.

- See, he's taking murder!

For your safety ask him

to sign on a blank paper

otherwise you'll read a tenant

broke his drunken landlord's

head with Bottle of wine and

siphoned off his property.

He's Taking All nonsense.

Maybe he is right.

You sign a blank paper.

Don't you trust me?

- He's some trick in his mind.

I pay rent you don't.

- So what, I'm ready to sign.

I'm ready too.

- What are you waiting for?

You both go out and

bring the paper.

Oh God! Why have you trapped

me in their fight.

Call me to yourself.

- No, call them to yourself.

See, I've signed the paper.

He has not signed.

There is something in his mind.

I'm signing.

Now what? Sign it.

What do you want?

Did you hear the song?

- Song?

He is making excuses ...

- You sign.

You really don't hear the song.

I hear it so clearly.

He's very cunning -

he's not going to sign.

Can I talk to Mr. Devi Prasad?

- No. Now what will you do?

Sir, what happened to my fish.

- I fried and ate it.

What are you doing here?

What's that girl doing here?

- She's our new employee.

With whose permission?

What's this nonsense?

Sir sweet balls.

- For what?

To celebration Anuradha's

appointment.

So you're impressing everybody

by offering them sweets.

Go and ask the manager.

- Surely I will ask?
You're misusing your position.

- What's the problem?

How did you give

my job to that girl.

hold a minute. You reply is in

this letter. Isn't it yours?

Letter!

Yes sir. You've written that

for now you don't need this job

I've written no such letter!

No! Then how is your signature?

Isn't it your signature?

Stop him! Govind! Rajaram!

Security! Get that letter.

He ate it!

- Sir open his stomach.

You just wait and see what I do

to your bank.

I will tell everybody you took

bribe to appoint this girl.

I'll get you both terminated

so there'll be two jobs for me.

I'll be trapped.

So you better terminated her

and appoint me here.

I've appointment letter -

nobody can terminate me.

I'll see you, first Let me deal

with man who gave you Letter.

You bastard

I'll kill you today.

I'll take your life.

Have you gone mad?

What're you doing, you're

breaking everything...

He has gone mad...

Abu bhaiya you don't interfere

You're bent upon destroying

whatever is left of garage.

Babu bhaiya counsel him.

- About what?

Where's my signed paper?

- What paper?

The paper I signed and gave you

- Look into the cupboard.

He wrote on it that I don't

need job and gave it that girl.

You move from here.

- Please stand between us.

Shut up!

I'm not afraid of going to

jail but I'm sparing him

because I want to see myself

working in a respectable job.

You go from here. And remember

if you break anything

I'll make you sleep with Ramlal

- Who's Ramlal.

The street dog!

If you had not come between us

I would have broken his teeth.

Did you steal that paper?

- Yes.

Well, you're not hurt, are you?

- No, not at all.

Then why were you shouting?

- It's Raju's style.

And this is Baburao's style!

So you planned this together.

- Don't touch me.

In the bank I'm a manager -
but here we are friends.

Then Hold hands and start

singing a duet.

You can make good jokes.

Don't bore me. My last warning...

terminate her, give me my job

Otherwise you'll lose your job

and retirement benefits.

Now our Life is in your hands.

- What can I do?

You can do a lot -

- just think, you're a woman.

What should I think?

You're cute and young. You can

control him Like Menaka.

I don't know anything.

- I'll train you for that.

Assume he is Vishwamitra who's

praying for job.

Like Indra I'll dress you Like

Menaka so you can divert him

No I can't act this love scene.

Try to befriend, otherwise we

both will Lose our jobs.

You did a nice setting for them

- It was hard but God helped.

Can you fix me with someone.

- What?

Have you some other beauty?

- Who do you think I am?

Pimp.

- I'm a manager not a pimp.

Okay, I'll treat you with

respect - show me some pictures

Listen, money is no problem

I'll pay as much as you want.

Go away or I'll beat you.

- How about tomorrow?

Why are you following me?

- What a manly gait!

Mine or yours?

- Your anger is attractive.

Aren't you ashamed - may I

shout to call police.

No need to be rude. If you

Like I can resign from the job.

Just give me 50,000

for this favor.

What? Fifty thousand!

Don't shout, I'm asking 50,000

not 500,000. People are ready

to pay 00,000 for this job.

You're trying to cheat me.

I won't give a single paisa.

Can I dial a local

number from here?

There is a call from Calcutta

for Savitri from her son.

Could you hear? - (Yes.)

- Then you send the Blankets.

You may hide anywhere -

but I'll find you.

What's this noise? What's

going on? Who's this man?

Not you. He's my friend. He has

borrowed 5,000 from me.

Are you looking for Shyam?

- His name is Ghanshyam.

But he doesn't work here.

- I know he works here.

Stop. Get out -

what type of man he is?

Come out Ghanshyam otherwise

Sis Ghanshyam took 5,000 and

promised to return after

getting a job. You Help me get

my money otherwise I can't

arrange my sister's marriage.

He said he got a job in bank.

Now he isn't here.

Where?

Either east or west Borivili.

Go to your seats and work.

You left village to hid here.

- Why you get angry to see me.

You bastard.. you disappear

whenever you see me...

This is his style to show Love...

What a strange style to

embrace till other chokes.

He should have broken his bones

you spoiled the wrestling show.

I had given him 5,000 rupees

at the death of his father.

Brother Khadag in this world

Love is important not money..
